I'm also sorry to hear that, despite the fact that we have very detailed records, including the x-rays that clearly show you have cavities, that you choose not to believe our associate dentist's report to you.  We give treatment options; so, if your retainer is broken, one of the options is replacement OR Invsalign (as the associate doesn't do braces).  It is not our philisophy to wait till a cavity makes a gaping hole in your tooth before we treat it.  It's ALWAYS better to treat them small to avoid excessive tooth structure removal when possible.We do examinations that other dentists simply don't have the experience or updated knowledge to perform INCLUDING bacterial analysis.  This is cutting edge stuff, not done by your average corner dentist.Our job is not to upsell, it's to ethically and truthfully tell you all that we see, NOT to treat to your insurance plan.   Diagnosing to insurance is ILLEGAL; if you've found a dentist that will do only that for you, then we are happy that you have moved on.The proof is in the pudding of the thousands of patients that have been seeing us for over 13 years now."

Often cases that may appear simple are more complicated than they appear, and it can be difficult to give you the appropriate advice over the telephone without seeing your pet in person. When we do recommend recheck appointments, it is to ensure that things are progressing as we expected, because if there is no improvement or the condition is worsening it is best to find out and adjust treatment if necessary sooner than later; and a pet's condition can change on a day to day basis. Unfortunately, we do need to charge for our services to ensure that we can continue to provide the best care possible for your pet as well as the rest of our patients. Ultimately, the best interest of your pet is at heart, and if you are satisfied with your regular vet, we encourage you to return to them. Thank you for your input as we strive to continually improve our services."

As communicated over the phone, Amber is an intermediate stylist and her price point is exactly the lower one under the senior stylist. As confirmed over the phone she is great, she has been with us almost since we open, and rarely she has an opening spot available on the same day due to her waiting list been always full. I'm so sorry it didn't work out for you as well. We are looking forward to have you coming in with the first stylist you were previously booked with, to have a chance to change your mind about us and finally find your to-go-to stylist. Thank you again, warmly. Ivan Bruna TEAM-TS."

We value our communities' opinions and are always looking to improve our processes to serve our patients better. Our clinic was undergoing an update to our phone systems to better serve our large patient community. Unfortunately, during this time we were experiencing some technical difficulties. This issue has now been resolved. We have also opened up more availability for medical appointments during evenings and weekends. We have always emphasized that any patient can still utilize all medical services through the clinic even if you have not been rostered to a specific physician. You are able to speak to physicians both virtually and in person and address almost all concerns. This would also not affect any continuity of care as you would have access to the full team. Once again we thank you for continuing to choose Integra Health and hope to serve you for all your health and wellness needs."

		"owner_response": "Hello Mr. Manuel,Thank you for providing this review.  I do apologize that we did not meet your expectations, however, I do want to clarify the points you provided below.  While I did not personally talk to you, since I had not joined the team yet, we did in fact keep in contact and address your concerns.  When you brought up the matter of the scratched rims, you were initially concerned about one rim.  Our manager, Lawrence, looked into the matter and based on our pictures, we could not 100% determine whether they curb rash was present or not.  As a gesture of good faith, and since you took the time to drive all the way to us and purchase with us, Lawrence agreed to repair the rim you were concerned about at no cost to you.  Following that conversation, you called back a little while later and requested that all 3 rims be repaired.  When you took the vehicle at delivery, you may or may not have noticed the curbed rims.  I can understand that.  When you did notice the damaged rim which you felt was undisclosed, we agreed to support since we appreciated that you trusted us with your business.  However, since you then requested that all 3 be repaired after we agreed to fix the one, it did bring up some challenges for us because we did give you a great deal on the vehicle.  As a compromise, we still wanted to see if we could work something out, so we offered the one rim repair complimentary, and for the 2 others, we would charge you our cost, and we would cover half of that cost.  We left this in your hands have not heard back from you since.Mr. Manuel, I apologize if there was any miscommunication.  We were under the impression that we were waiting for your call back.  We are fully transparent with our products and upon delivery, you get a chance to inspect the vehicle and make note of anything concerning.  I can understand that at times things may get overlooked by the guest, but we are willing to listen and investigate the matter and work with our guest so that they have a great experience and are completely satisfied with their purchase. Having said that, our offer of support still stands.  We will repair one rim complimentary, and for the other 2, we will charge you half the cost price of the repair.Please let Bob or Lawrence know whether or not you wish to proceed.Yours Truly,Andrew LeeGeneral Manager"

Some of the patients you saw go ahead of you may have been waiting for their appointment with their primary care provider and not the walk-in doctor on duty. We are always striving to improve wait times for all our patients, but the reality of medicine today is that the system is overburdened. We appreciate your patience when wait times are long and we want to assure you we are doing our best to address all our patients concerns with the appropriate amount of time and attention."

We really appreciate your kind comments about our team, and completely understand that parking can certainly be frustrating around our facility as we are right on the very busy Kingston Road.

We also allow clients to drop their pets off at the door and then allow time to go and park safely, wait to be called by the doctor and when the appointment is finished, we can bring pet back out to you when you pull up outside.Having our extended hours certainly does help with allowing for a wider range of appointment slots available at off peak times. We are open Monday to Friday 8am to 11pm and Sat, Sun and holidays 10am to 10pm.We continuously aim to do everything we can to accomodate and really appreciate the patience and understanding you had with us 😊 Have a wonderful day!Fiona, Practice Manager"

We truly appreciate your loyalty over the past 5 years and your trust in Marie-Eve for your various hair color transformations. It's fantastic to hear how you've embraced different styles, from colored/marbled roots to all-over fashion colors. The decision to opt for a balayage approach to handle the grow-outs given your distance from Toronto is a smart strategy, allowing for a stunning look even with up to 16 weeks between appointments."

We just received the vehicle direct from Roy Foss, our sales rep Kevin looked at the carproof which is clean and does not show any damage records, however there was a damage estimate that was just put through insurance a few days ago. It usually take a few weeks for it to show on the carproof report.  We have the full estimate of repairs and disclose all damage records. If you have any further inquiries please contact Rahul 416-561-3990 or don't hesitate to come in. Thank you"

I have worked 20 years to create full transparency, and its important each and every customer feels safe and receive trustworthy, friendly customer service excellence.   I personally suffer from anxiety and I am very anti scare tactics, and a rare communication lingo we use  in extreme situations  like a brake line leaking  brake fluid, we would say \"you should tow it in order to keep you safe\" . We have all the measurements and notes of a requested brake inspection which triggered your visit.  We have no notes customer advised to tow vehicle . I want to clarify that the quote was for front brake pads and rotors, rear brake pads, rotors and the calipers and an oil change, not just the rear brakes. I understand the rear brake calipers are in question.   The front brake pads measured at 2mm.  The rear brake pads were at 3mm with evidence of  premature wear on rear brake pads.  In our phone conversation I wholeheartedly implored you to come in and have us inspect the rear brake calipers and offered to refund the brake repair from the other shop so we can perform the re-inspection to compensate you  for your time.  Did they replace the front or rear brake pads and rotors ?  The front brake calipers were fine, could that be the difference of opinion be  in the status of calipers, the front instead of the rear?   As business owners we aim for perfection, but if my technician made an error, I would like to at least make this into a learning experience  and make sure it is never repeated. The owner declined for us to verify what the other mechanic said,  or if the third mechanic even checked the rear calipers. The owners decline in a                re- inspection visit makes  it impossible  to answer your question about the calipers and even confirm if front or rear brakes where replaced. :(  Also, what quality of brake pads and rotors was used, as price is in question.  We offer the best warranty in the business which is 1 year 20,000km. We use quality Napa parts, and our reputation of a balance of service, price and quality parts is known fact.Thank you again for taking my call,  and for updating  and retracting parts of the original review you were kind to update the information.  You asked in the original  review  \" why is this place costed over 4 times what the competition is charging\"  I am very thankful you removed that incorrect information, sadly wrong facts can ruin a business,  you were comparing front brake and rotors, rear brake pads, rotors and calipers and and an oil change cost to just doing front brake pads and rotors.  The offer is still on the table at anytime for us to re-inspect,  I'm all about truth and facts.Sending good vibes to you, the owner of the vehicle and your new mechanic."

Then we can start adding a little more variety, I believe in doing the same exercises so you can master the form and your mechanics and then you will be good for many years to come and you can build on top of it, again thank you for training with us we wish you all the best.

		"owner_response": "Hi Georgiana,    Thank you so much for your review and sorry you didn’t have the exceptional experience most of our clients have when visiting the salon, as that is always our goal. As an owner I want to make sure everything goes as planned when a customer comes in to visit, so I went back to look at the footage to see how your visit went again and spoke to all parties involved, just to mention I was also there for your appointment. You were greeted nicely along with another client when you arrived by front of house Tyrone and also by our lovely stylist who took care of you on the day once you were seated. You where offered beverages, received water and your appointment began.Unfortunately we don’t shake hands with clients since Covid and customers sometimes feel uncomfortable when embracing them unless we truly know a client and their preferences but honestly we would love to embrace everyone when they walk in but I’m sure you can understand why we can’t do that. Your service went as planned, you graciously arriving on time at 2.30pm, starting your service at 2.40pm after your introduction and mixing your colour. Since you have beautiful thick hair it took 30 mins to apply your roots properly with finer sections to get all of the hair evenly. Full colour development is 45 mins and our stylist used foil at the sides and left 5 extra mins to ensure you had really good coverage. As a new client we don’t know your hair just yet and how resistant it might be so we air on the side of caution. Bringing colour through the ends to add shine at the basin and washing it out took 15 mins to ensure no colour is left in the hair. Then blowdrying thicker hair and curling after usually takes around 45 mins. Putting everything together takes about 2/ 2.5 hours, especially as a new client as the stylist wants to ensure your hair is done impeccably. We are not a salon that rushes clients, we like to make sure you are taken care of and that the end product is the best possible. We have never been a salon that wants people in and out quickly as it can compromise the result and if you have any time restraints you can always communicate that so we make sure we get you out as quickly as possible. The stylist taking care of you also works a little quieter, is a newer stylist and is working on being a little more confident with interactions. Every stylist’s personality is different and if anything, I feel I can say she was very nice and sweet to you as I was also working two chairs down and all seemed to be great. As an owner I have eyes in the back of my head to make sure everyone is doing ok 😂. We all work differently and how we like to deliver our services. I do feel we can always learn from reviews and take accountability and I think learning from this that we will also ask our clients if they need to be out quickly, do they have any time restraints etc… I am glad you where happy with your hair and would love to have you back in again to enjoy a quicker more enjoyable service. If you can email me personally at info@thecellarsalon.com and I’m happy to chat about your next experience and how we can make your service more enjoyable for your needs and I would personally do it myself, handshake and all. Have a great rest of week.Aaron "

As we do not know if you have these items at your place or not.But the state of california also has a law for restaurants not to include utensils or condiments unless they are requested for waste reasons. And if they are not requested when you place your order online for delivery.It state on or end  on the ordering tablet.(Do not include utensils )..We have no control of that as it is the ordering apps system.As far as the salad , we Offer a California kale Ceasar salad.There is no description of this salad thru the ordering app,That is certainly something I will be addressing and getting updated to avoid customer confusion.And last but not leastThis was a delivery so the crust may soften up a little during transport.And there is a possibility the delivery driver did not use a hot bag.As it is a 3rd party delivery service Ran by Doordash usa.and that is out of are controlBut we do ask all driver if they are using a hot bag before the food goes out.For any and all mishap we are sorry..As we aim to please,But If you are in town this weekend,Saturday or Sunday 5PM Thru MidnightCall me at 310 359 6969We will have our personal delivery person bring you a pie on the house with free delivery.And a order of wings.We will include red chili flakes,Parmesan cheese and Napkins.And Hopefully make us your go to pie spot.Have a great Day and Thank you for your feedback it is helpful for us moving forward.We will note this as a learning Experience.

Unfortunately with that as a side, we had customers who reheat their food and then we have complaints on sore food. We tried steamed fresh broccoli, carrots and string beans. Unfortunately if meals are not eaten immediately the broccoli starts to smell and we receive phone calls our food is spoiled. We thought of incorpating fry plantain as part of the side, however plantain is not always available or ripe. The end result is the steam mixed veggies,not the best compliments to our Jerk chicken  but one that receives the least amount of complaint on spoilage. Thanks again for your visit.

Only due and recommended treatment were performed. We would like to remind our patients that insurance plans are not the same as treatment plans. Remember, we are treating you, not your insurance!
