We received Amber into our care as a walk-in emergency case when we were already fully booked, recognizing that she was severely injured and was actively bleeding. Dr. Regan immediately placed her as priority above our other non-emergent patients at the time who had appointments booked, and also chose not to charge an emergency fee to you and your family.Due to the severity of her injuries from being attacked, the most humane thing to do is to administer pain control to alleviate the pain from the multiple puncture wounds found on her neck and head. With pain medications on board, Amber will hopefully be more comfortable before we proceed with other possible treatments  i.e putting in an IV catheter, administering fluids, doing a small blood draw to check if she is anemic from blood loss, or even x-rays to check how severe her injuries were. Imagine having a broken bone, and your doctor needed to take x-rays of it without giving you any pain control. That would be extremely painful and horrible to go through, and we do not wish that upon our patients.We try to keep our patients as calm and comfortable as possible, and we wish we could have done more to help Amber. However sometimes even our best is not enough in emergency situations like this.Deepest Condolences,Marielle l Hospital Coordinator"

There are a few things that you possibly weren’t aware of and we hope this will clear things up for you:1) King East Dental is a general dentistry office.  There is currently not an oral surgeon at the office and there never has been an oral surgeon at this office.  An exam with a general dentist and imaging is usually required to get a referral to a specialist’s office.2) The dentist was asked by your spouse to check more than one area. Imaging and treatment planning was done for more treatment other than just the extraction.3) Your spouse can be treated at our office for everything planned (including the extraction) but it will have to be delayed due to a recent health reason that was not revealed to the dentist until the patient was examined.  The specialist referral was only given if the extraction is needed urgently as his safety is of importance to us.4)The dentist actually reduced the price of the examination fee by around 50% for your spouse.Please know that you both can contact us at any point if you need any further clarification or assistance.We really hope to continue our relationship with you.Sincerely,King East Dental"

Patient care is always our priority.A core teaching in medicine is that there is no guarantee that you can only have one problem at a time. In fact over time, one problem often leads to another. To whatever extent we need to see you in person to reassess, it's exactly for your type of situation; we want to reassess to see if there needs to be a change in management.Your comment alludes to what I would consider medical malpractice and OHIP billing fraud which is certainly a very serious allegation of criminal offense. I would suggest that Google reviews may not be best place to allege that a crime has taken place. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario routinely audits physicians in Ontario. If you have a concern about either our patient management or billing practices, you can reach them at www.cpso.on.ca. I would be happy to review your medical treatment with yourself and the CPSO at any time.I will note that we proudly have never had a \"one-issue-per-visit\" policy at our clinic - it is one of Patient Networks' founding principles."

We contacted the third party booking service that handles our phone services and conducted an investigation of the event. This Customer Care Representative (CCR)’s comment in the shift call log was that his conversations with you were very unpleasant due to “rudeness and insulting language.” He felt personally attacked and he decided to call you himself despite the service provision policy. We were notified that this CCR resigned from his position after being told that he would need to undergo re-training before resuming his CCR duties.We are very disappointed with this CCR’s lack of professionalism in this sensitive situation.  We have been assured by our third party booking service that this will not happen again and that this new hire who had been with the service for less than a month was not representative of their standard of care to us or to our clients. This momentary lapse of judgement on the part of this former CCR is also NOT representative of who we are as a veterinary service and what we stand for.That being said, just a gentle reminder to all patrons looking to utilize any of our services: We aim to cultivate an environment for our support staff where they can expect to be treated with dignity and respect.

We hope this will change over time, as the pigment in lip blushing usually takes several weeks to reappear on the lips after treatments.The pain in lip blushing certainly varies from person to person, which is why we use multiple numbing agents to minimize discomfort. While I know you had your reservations about the pain after your original appointment, your technician was under the impression the adjusted numbing regiment used at your touch-up had made a dramatic difference with pain reduction. If that wasn't the case, we'd love to hear more about your experience in order to prevent issues with other clients, and we've reached out to you directly in regards to this.Since we mix a custom hue for each client doing lip blushing, we often show the mixture itself rather than using a colour book to show the finished colour. This is especially true in cases where the lips are darker and require neutralization, as everyone's lips react differently to the same pigments.We'll reach out directly again 5 weeks after your appointment to see how things have settled. I know the pigment disappearing can be nerve-wracking, but it's an expected part of the healing process.Thanks,The Beauty House Team"

We've invested thousands of dollars to create as safe of an environment as we can.  Our issues are with the selective measures that are being taken by the Government.  Restaurants have had very little impact on the number of Covid-19 cases in London and other areas.  Yet we face some of the harshest guidelines throughout different industries.  We are the only industry that is dictated hours of operation.  Our capacity is now limited to 10 people (same are gyms) where as retail stores can operate at a much greater number.  Restaurants, as well as other stores, are required to screen every person coming in. I've yet to come across one \"Big Box\" store that follows this guideline (small retail stores pay for an employee to screen at the entrance).  The Ale House, like many other places, have had to layoff many employees that we value greatly.  We are \"fighting\" (being vocal) for them as well as all other businesses that are struggling through these times."

It is NOT undercooked.Brisket is more tender and does not require a knife. That said, we usually have metal cutlery, but have issues with customers who throw it out with their food garbage.

I understand that coping with your loss must have only been made more difficult with the delays in cremation deliveries from our third party cremation company.Upon learning about your initial frustration with the speed of the cremation services, I was personally upset about your situation and contacted the cremation company myself to determine the cause of the delivery delay.  They stated that you had purchased a special paw print item which indicated, on their third party website, at the time of purchase, that it will take 3 to 4 weeks for shipment.  At this point it had been less than 4 weeks since the time of purchase.  I was also informed that due to COVID there was an additional 1 week delay in shipment.  We then proceeded to inform you of the reason for the delay.  Since you had selected a special paw print that none of our clients had ever purchased in the past, we were not aware that the shipment would take more than the typical 1-2 weeks for delivery. However, our third party cremation services website stated this clearly when you purchased the item. We then proceeded to split up the shipments for you as you requested so that you could have your beloved pets remains more promptly.As far as prices for services and clarity of communications, I have only interacted with your partner when discussing your cats very serious condition.  I had been strongly urging your partner to proceed with surgical treatment for your pets condition, suggesting external surgical specialist treatment (with absolutely no monetary benefit to us).  I had several lengthy telephone conversations, without charge, with your husband detailing possible treatment plans and encouraging surgery to attempt to save your cats life.  You elected to treat medically the condition and we continued to refill medications for 1 year without rechecking your pet or checking blood tests, in direct consideration of your cost concerns.  Our veterinary regulatory body requires us to examine a patient at least yearly in order to continue to prescribed chronic medications.  After a year we retested your cats blood, with an extensive blood test, considering the seriousness of your cats eventually fatal condition.You have not personally been directly involved in any communications regarding your pets illness.  Hopefully the above explanation clarifies that I have been considerate of balancing your cost concerns with attempting to treat your cats life threatening illness."

		"owner_response": "Hello Yady,I am very sorry to hear that your recent experience at our clinic did not meet your expectations. The reason you had initially requested an appointment with us was to discuss ways that we can help get your rescue dog groomed as a few grooming facilities that you tried to take him too were unsuccessful in the past and your previous vet clinic had to resort to fully sedating him for shave downs. You also made it clear that he is extremely reactive, dislikes being groomed, tries to bite and that no one has been able to put a muzzle on him so far. Our veterinarian along with our technicians were eventually able to examine your pet but as you can imagine it was not the easiest task as he was quite reactive. We were able to listen to his heart and lungs which sounded normal, though a full examination was not possible given his temperament. Our veterinarian did go through a few options on how we can prescribe some anxiety medications that can help make future in clinic visits less stressful, all of which were then declined.  Our priority is to provide a safe and fear-free experience for our patients both for medical appointments and grooming services. Since this was our first time meeting Zachy, it was important for our veterinarian to gauge the level of anxiety that Zachy exhibits in clinic in order to provide a treatment plan for moving forward. I apologize that the treatment plan offered was not the one you had hoped for, however considering your pet's history of fear based aggression, it is recommended that he be sedated for grooming to reduce the risk of him injuring himself or others during the process. Ultimately our goal is to advocate for our patients, and our hope is that we can work together with you to navigate Zachy's needs.Please feel free to reach out to us directly to discuss further.Melanie, Practice Manager "

Perhaps ford need do better job building their vehicles regardless of anything our warranty provider paid for the repairs and as a goodwill we paid for her deductible.

		"owner_response": "Dear Tiffany,Our services do start at $150+HST for the home visit (this includes the mobile/booking and pet examination fee).  This is clearly stated on the webpage that you used to book your home visit with us.  It is also noted on the invoice you received from your online booking, and the Customer Service Representative you spoke with on the phone confirmed with you that our veterinary services start at $150+HST.  So it is not clear how you came to the conclusion that a pet euthanasia done at your home would cost $150.  Our home euthanasia appointments require a lot of preparation and include aftercare options such as transportation of your pet after he/she has been euthanized from your home to the crematorium, cremation, ashes return, and keepsakes.  There’s a lot of time, thought, and labor involved in these more intimate and personalized visits.As for the email Dr. Tina sent you, you did express during your consultation with Dr. Tina that you were adamant about proceeding with euthanasia for your diabetic cat as you could not afford your previous veterinarian's treatment plan to start treatment for her.  You even rejected Dr. Tina’s suggestion of surrendering Jimmy to the Humane Society for re-adoption.   Dr. Tina ended the visit with you by offering you her deepest condolences for this painful decision, and you seemed to acknowledge and appreciate her compassion for your situation.  Dr. Tina only merely referenced this again in her follow-up email to you.We are all pet owners here at this service.  We understand how difficult it can be to say goodbye to a pet, and so I hope you don’t misconstrue Dr. Tina’s heartfelt message speaking to the decision you had made regarding Jimmy as anything other than that.-------------We would like to kindly remind everyone that we do offer Phone Consults, which is a service that connects you directly with one of our veterinarians over the phone.  During this phone conversation the veterinarian will answer any general questions about our service, address any specific medical concerns you may have about your pet, and provide you with a plan of care tailored to your specific needs along with a quote for your home visit.Respectfully,Dmitry, Office Manager of the Toronto Mobile Veterinary Services."

For this reason, we cannot verify which stylist you are referring to in your review nor can we verify that you were a client at our salon. We would like to take this opportunity to assure you that all of our stylists have several years of experience and have completed extensive training & education. Notably, our stylists are committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience and this often entails asking for feedback at the end of an appointment to ensure that the client is happy with the results of their hair. We care about your experience and we would like more details of what occurred. If you would like to discuss further, you may contact us at info@clsalon.com.Update: Thank you Cassandra for your update. We said we cannot verify you as a client does not mean that you weren’t and that we are calling you a liar. We take our client feedback seriously and It’s just that we have searched your name in our database and it did not show up. Please let us know if you booked in with another name. In addition, we have a few male stylists at our salon and because we cannot verify which male stylist you saw, we wouldn’t be able to see what happened with the service and have the opportunity to learn from it and improve. Finally, you never gave us a chance to make things right and see what adjustments could’ve been done but instead went on Google to bash/threaten our salon and our stylist and say that their work is incompetent. We cannot say that our work is flawless nor can we say that we can make every client walking in 100% satisfied. We believe that no salon can guarantee that either. What we can say is that we always aim to achieve our clients’ vision and recommend suggestions despite the service is required. We understand the frustration when one is not satisfied with the service but there’s nothing we can do if no chance were given. About our salon, we do have clients that are in wheelchairs. We try our best to accommodate each and every clients. If need be, we can open the front door for our clients and move our cutting chairs. Unfortunately, we cannot 100% tailor to every clients needs due to limited resources and space and we sincerely apologize for that. We apologize for your experience. If you would like to further discuss, you may contact us at info@clsalon.com. Thank you and have yourself a lovely day"

We only have one entrance for both aspects of the hospital, which would explain why you witnessed other patients being seen first.  Veterinary emergency departments run like human emergency departments, based on triage.  We are often inundated with patients which contributes to long wait times.  We strive to see every patient as expeditiously as possible, however; the wait times can still be long for patients considered stable. We are happy to hear your pet was able to be seen by your family vet in a timely manner and hope they are recovering well. Sincerely, TAHP Management "

There are several details that you left out with the big one being that you had just finished a 1 week trial with us from 7/6 - 7/12 a few days before this 2 week trial you discuss in your review. As you mentioned, trials are for new people. So when you bought another trial on 7/17, our membership manager explained that you were not eligible for a second trial and refunded you the $45 on 7/19 and that you would need to purchase a 1 week pass at normal price to finish off the week, which you agreed to in person and you purchased the pass and continued to train for the rest of the week. And our system normally does block people from buying a second trial, but you created a 2nd account under Beth Smith using a different email, so our system treated you as a new person. It is only when my staff recognized you were the same person, were we able to explain that you can only do a trial once. But I do apologize if the way it was explained by my staff came off as patronizing. I'm sure that was not their intent. From what I understood, it seemed like you enjoyed your experience w/ us so we were quite shocked to read such a negative review. We will be more careful about how we explain our studio policies."

We appreciate reviews like this because it allows patients to make informed decisions prior to coming into the clinic.1) Our walk-in wait time can be upwards of 1.5 to 2 hours if we are busy.  Depends on how many people are trying to access our walk-in at any given time.2) We are still very cautious during covid so we do ask patients to self swab at the clinic.  If you come into the clinic with symptoms we will also ask you to do a covid test prior to accessing the walk-in clinic.3) Coming to walk-in does not mean you will get a prescription.  It is up to the doctor if a prescription will be given or not.  Having a sore throat does not mean you will get a prescription and waiting in walk-in does not mean you will get a prescription.  It is all on doctor's decision on whether it is needed.4) Sick notes, medical notes and forms all have a fee.  $22 is the standard fee for a sick note.5) Most walk-in appointments will be between 5- 10 min but could be longer if necessary.I would like to know about the staff being rude at front desk.  There are times where patients are less than their best at front desk that the staff will need to be firm but no one should be rude.  Please send me an email with more details at management@gshclinics.com so that I can look into it further or potentially use the situation for future training sessions with the staff.Thanks again for taking the time rate and review our clinic.

We understand the frustration of being in such severe pain and not receiving the relief you expected during your initial visit. Typically, an initial chiropractic assessment includes both evaluation and treatment if time permits. However, in some cases, especially when dealing with intricate issues, the assessment can take longer and treatment is started on a separate day. In other cases, hands-on care may be delayed if medication may be helpful.   While we understand your disappointment about not receiving immediate treatment, we feel it's important to prioritize accurate diagnosis and prevent worsening symptoms.Your feedback about your experience is valuable, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused.

While we strive to provide the best service to clients and the most comfortable experience for our patients, this is not always possible with anxious pets. From my understanding, your puppy was not cooperative upon examination by the doctor. For the safety of our staff members, the pet owners, and the patients themselves, we must take preventative measures such as restraint with cone/muzzle, intramuscular sedation (which would have been difficult given that not even you were able to safely muzzle or restrain him), or pre-medications which were prescribed to you for future veterinary visits. To accommodate for how anxious he was, with the help of several technicians the doctor was able to quickly administer the vaccines, and prescribed conservative eye medications for his conditions. We do apologize for not having a new cone at hand for when he came in, as our regular Elizabethan collars are soft and made of fabric, his teeth would have easily broke through if he wished to bite."

I was not able to acquire camera footage for the day of your visit to directly observe your experience, but if you would like to discuss this further, I'm happy to do so. Not all of our tiny friends require carrying, and I believe our staff member was likely encouraging your puppy to take a few steps on her own but she decided to apply full brakes. Patient comfort is a top priority, and it is important to us that we do not want to put any pet in a position where they are uncomfortable whenever possible. I see it noted on file that your sweet chihuahua was extremely nervous, and we opted not to perform her examination, but try again at a future date with an oral anti-anxiety medication given ahead of time so she would have as smooth a visit as possible. Several of our staff are Fear-Free certified, and we implement their techniques as much as we can for an ideal pet experience. I hope this better conveys the compassion that truly we have for the pets in our care! If you would like to talk further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

In January you wanted to trade in and buy a brand new car, we  told you we do not sell new cars. You went to Toyota and bought a new vehicle, you traded in your car for a price we told you should be much higher, we would have paid you much more than the amount you agreed to sell it for.

Upon booking appointments, we always let clients know that once the vet has completed their exam and reviewed any previous medical/vaccination records, they will be able to give you an exact cost of services that the pet may require.  It is a bit difficult to give clients costs over the phone as each pet has different needs and therefore will require different vaccinations etc.    Kittens require 3 sets of boosters at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age.  That is why you were given the costs for the next appointment your kitten should have in order to complete their kitten vaccination series.Melanie, Practice Manager  "

The VIN number did decode there were heated seats in the vehicle. There was no mention of the vehicle having power seats. Again, this was a dealer to dealer transaction, so please reach out to your finance broker, as they did not do their due diligence when purchasing the vehicle from us.

After review our records and our team's observation of Cindy's interaction, we have concluded that  you simply did not feel comfortable proceeding with our treatment options and cost.    Our team observed Cindy providing you different breakdowns and different sedation options.   Our records show an email was sent to you explaining the different option available, which you claim that we were not upfront with the prices .    Cindy did her best to explain and deliver the cost of your emergency visit to our practice.  Infact, the total price was significantly reduced to help you financially.   The quoted price that was mention was the total cost of your visit.  Yes, an examination was performed.  Dr. Barati was the attending dentist whom you had the pleasure of meeting.   The poking around as you claim, is part of the examination.  Together with the Panoramic x-ray and poking around is simply to rule out any abnormal growths that may be present.   This is our routine with every single patient that comes through our practice.  You left our office with a completed prescription for an antibiotic.   A patient cannot get a prescription in a dental office without an examination.  Our team's feedback with regards to your 2nd interaction with Cindy (follow up phone call) their response:  Cindy was understanding and compliant.    She explained the emergency intake and cost.  Rebecca, thank you for your feedback and we wish well with your search for the right dental practice to attend to your emergency.  Better Life, Better Smile, HD team."

		"owner_response": "Dear Ms. Leslie Cook,At this time, our standard mobile/booking fee is $120+HST, as is listed on our website. This initial upfront cost can be higher if, for example, there is more than one pet to be seen; if the patron's address is outside of our general service boundaries; if our patron is requesting veterinary home care service outside of our regular business hours (should it be available). In this way, the mobile/booking fee for a home visit in Hamilton, for example, would be higher than the mobile/booking fee for a home visit in North York. Unfortunately, this reviewer did not include this information, so we are not able to verify the accuracy of her statement.We would like to note that bringing a veterinary hospital to a private home does take a lot of thought, organization, and effort.  This process starts right from the minute the initial upfront mobile/booking fee is taken and includes (but not limited to): reserving a veterinarian and nurse's standby time for the booked visit; driving route pre-planning and scheduling which accounts for our pets' specific needs and locations; pre-arrangement of patient-specific medication and equipment in packages - including disinfection as per COVID-19 standards - for loading into the vehicle on appointment day; and other tasks.We would also like to take this opportunity to remind our clients and interested patrons that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, appointments do take longer than usual as we need additional time to disinfect and sanitize our PPE, veterinary equipment, and the area in the home where we set up our temporary veterinary clinic, all to minimize the risk of transmission, so please plan your home visit accordingly. We value the safety of our pet guardians and staff highly, and are doing everything we can to protect our wonderful community of pets and pet guardians, especially considering that many of our clients are seniors, immune-compromised individuals, families with small children, and disabled persons.Respectfully,Dmitry, Office Manager of the Toronto Mobile Veterinary Services."

We apologize if there was any miscommunication regarding the next steps and prescribed medication.As discussed, there were no signs of obstruction shown in the radiograph, and blood work results with no significant indication of any other underlying causes for the vomiting. The doctor discussed and received your and/or your partner's consent to treat Nickel with supportive care for moderate acute gastroenteritis. It was also discussed that we expect Nickel to be more tired at home when he feels relaxed, as sedation was required for us to proceed with the examination and diagnostics due to Nickel exhibiting stressful behaviour during his stay with us.We hope this helps to clarify and we will be reaching out shortly to follow up on how Nickel is doing.Sincerely,Carissa TPractice Manager"

We understand how hard it is, especially when you've done as much as you can to fight for her. Summer was a lovely dog, and we know how much she meant to you and your family. We will miss her.We'd like to address the concerns you've raised here. We appreciate the expense that you went to to help Summer live long and well. Please know that we did our best to help achieve this for her and you, both, and it was never our intention to make you feel the way you've mentioned here. We do see from our records that our team (both Dr. Finora as well as his technician) had been in touch with you as to the reason we recommended seeing your rDVM first, as well as having offered options for seeing us, if needed. If you want to discuss it further, please do give us a call. Please understand that when we've been informed that a patient will be euthanized, we will not call a client to confirm this for the sake of the sensitive and difficult time they may be having. We apologize if we did not reach out in a manner you'd expected, but we do hope you received the acknowledgment of her passing that we sent at the time.Regarding Summer's life expectancy, while we may have data-supported outlooks for the conditions we treat our patients for, we cannot make guarantees. Medicine is not perfect, and therefore, we cannot perfectly anticipate what may happen in the future. We do wish that Summer had had longer with you to enjoy her remission, and we're sorry that she took a turn so soon and it was not so.

Although you had made a booking and we allocated one and a half hour of our time and resources to you.3. Before booking you were informed in writing and documented, that it will be a new patient appointment (exam + x-rays+ cleaning) and you were informed that we will help out with your insurance, but you will be responsible for your insurance coverage and the appointment payment.If you review the chain of messages, you will see everything was clearly explained. 4. “prices are so high because the doctor goes to university of Toronto” is definitely mis-interpreted and is a very incorrect statement "

When we have reached our medical capacity we cannot take any walk-ins. This is done to ensure that there is no extended waiting and that patient care quality care is not sacrificed for quantity of patients. As for any no show fees these are standard and within the regulator guidelines. These are simply done to enforce appointment times since there are many people that need it and we want to discourage missed appointments that could be take by others.

In many urgent cases we see, we will ultimately end up referring them to an emergency clinic if we feel that we do not have the facilities to give the pet the care they need (eg. round the clock care, immediate surgery, referral to a specialist, etc).

Beef Souvlaki is a completely different dish and is prepared with different styles of beef. Next time, if unsure please ask our staff for any clarifications before ordering to avoid any disappointment. Also, our dinners are served with very generous portions of our home-cooked rice, potatoes and include 12oz of Beefteki, so we believe this is a very fair price considering the quality and amount of food you are receiving.

We completely understand what a devastating and frustrating time this must have been for your family especially during these unprecedented times. Thank you for providing this feedback. We are saddened to hear that your family were disappointed with the service that was provided by our team. We understand how hard it is for new clients to a clinic to get an appointment during these times so our team went above and beyond to fit your little one in for an appointment during a day which we were already fully booked. Our team followed our standard protocols for a euthanasia. As this pet was new to our clinic the doctor had to perform an examination in order to establish a Vet-Client-Patient-Relationship before any medical procedure can be performed, which does incur a standard examination fee. Our team got the patient checked in and then provided the appropriate documentation to sign before any procedures/preparations can be performed. Our hospital procedure is to have payment taken before any treatment/procedure begins as in our experience clients prefer to have everything done before hand so that they can spend every precious moment afterwards focusing on their pet. During Covid times our company policy is to allow 1 person in with their pet during a euthanasia. This was even more relevant during the timing of the appointment as we as a city/community were right in the middle of the Omicron wave of Covid-19. As your family were new to our clinic, they would not have been used to our policies and we apologize that they may have seemed different, but these policies are what have worked for our team for a long time. Our team continue to do their very best to be able to continue to be there for the people and pets of this community and follow certain policies and protocols to do so. If the person who is named on the file would like to speak to us further then they can contact us at 416-690-0625 or reception@vetstoronto.com Warm regards, Fiona. Practice Manager"

We provide access to medical care as an alternative to the emergency room or sometimes overburdened primary care providers, so unfortunately there is sometimes a wait associated with that.Our staff enter postal codes and address based on hand written intake forms provided by patients.

We completely understand that unexpected expenses can be challenging, and we appreciate your concern about the cost, especially considering the potential need for extensive dental procedures.Upon reviewing the details of your appointment, it appears there might have been some miscommunication during the discussion with the veterinarian. We acknowledge that veterinary appointments can involve a lot of information, especially when addressing the health concerns of a pet, and it can be challenging to absorb all the details, especially in stressful situations.During the appointment, the veterinarian explored various medications and treatment options while being mindful of cost considerations. There was a particular emphasis on the potential risks associated with certain medications. The vet was cautious and sought to discuss the most effective and lasting solutions for your cat's dental issues.To address your concerns about over-the-counter products, the vet did provide information as per your request. However, it was clarified that these might serve more as maintenance rather than a comprehensive solution to the underlying dental problems.In an effort to ensure clarity and address any lingering questions, would it be acceptable for one of our veterinarians to give you a call? They can go over the details of the appointment again, providing a thorough explanation of the proposed treatment plan. We want to ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of your pet's health needs and the associated costs.Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further with you."

We understand that you made an appointment with one of our sales representatives to view a specific Jaguar we had in our lot. The appointment was set for 3:30 on March 9th. You unfortunately did not make it for that time nor did you update our sales representative that you were going to be late. You did, however, arrive at approximately 5pm which is an hour and a half later than your scheduled meeting with Josef. Shortly before your arrival another client visited our showroom and showed interest in this particular vehicle. Communicating this to you would not have solved the issue because he came in minutes before you arrived. We would have also appreciated some communication on your part so that we would be able to accommodate you for a later time. The other gentleman looking at the vehicle had not yet made the purchase when you arrived and if he had we would have surely notified you. In addition, we always try to inform our clients that they can hold vehicles with a deposit if they wish so that this situation does not take place as it is an uncomfortable situation for everyone including us because we don’t want to see anyone upset. All in all we strive to make all of our clients happy and invite you to give us a call to clear up the matter and even find a vehicle to your liking if we don’t already have one in our inventory. 416 645 0196.

This would have been recommended to also save you any additional hassle from presenting to our office and then needing to be sent away.

I understand that Cee Cee's illness was extremely challenging, and our veterinarian communicated their concerns about her critical condition to you and your family members on multiple occasions during the visit. It's always our priority to provide the best possible care and guidance to pet owners facing such difficult decisions.Regarding the decision of our DVM suggesting not to transfer Cee Cee to another clinic for euthanasia, our primary concern was her well-being. Our veterinarian expressed concerns about Cee Cee's fragile condition and the potential risks associated with the journey of transferring her. Ultimately, the decision was made with Cee Cee's best interests in mind, and we apologize for any distress this may have caused you.Regarding the costs associated with Cee Cee's ICU care and potential surgery by a board-certified surgeon, we understand that financial considerations can add additional stress during an already emotional time. We strive to be transparent about the costs of treatment and always discuss potential expenses with pet owners to ensure they are well-informed. Due to the extent of Cee Cee's illness and the 24/7 care she would need in ICU this is something your RDVM would be unable to provide and unfortunately the costs associated with this care are higher.If there is anything we can do to assist you or if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at Manager@tahp.vet"

I couldn't find your name in the system but It looks like you probably booked an appointment online for what you thought the service might have been called (the price seems to  refer to a colour, haircut and blow-dry or a full bleach, olaplex) however, when you came in salon and explained the stylist what you were looking for, might have been a totally different service of what you previously selected online (ex. for the price you mentioned, it might have been a Balayage, olaplex and haircut and blow-dry). We usually always confirm the price before starting a service or the guests will ask us how much it is going to be. However, I can assure we always charge for the right service that was performed but contact us directly via email at: info@tonyshamas.ca with the details of your appointment (date/time/stylist) and I will make sure to look into it, and have this resolved in case there were any mistakes price-wise.

I have spoken with our staff, and we tried validating your HC number in our system but it came back invalid, therefore we had charged the deposit. Many of our patients return with there physical copy of the health card and we are more than happy to provide them back the amount they paid. In previous cases where patients had forgotten there HC at home, we had asked them to bring it back so we can process them into our system, however they would fail to return. Therefore it is under protocol that we only keep a deposit until the patient returns with their card.I hope this answers your questions, however again I am sorry for the trouble,Thank youManagement"

We dip our loukoumades in our honey syrup when they come out of the fryer so they absorb a little on the inside. I’m not sure if this is the “oily” you are referring to but we use nothing but fresh oils for our loukoumades. Also, our syrup has a tint of cinnamon in it, so if you dislike cinnamon all together, this might be the problem. Please give us a call so we can discuss this further and rectify the situation. We never want to have any customer dissatisfied with our product.. We will give you the same 3 boxes you ordered but with no syrup dip and you can try these to see if they are better for you.

By trying to get it right the first time instead of blindly running tests can actually save you money and allow your pet to receive appropriate medical treatment faster. It’s also a legal requirement to create a veterinarian-client-patient relationship prior to initiating any treatments on an animal as per our governing body, the CVO. If a client has a specific service in mind regarding their pet’s care, we encourage them to discuss it with the doctor at the time of the appointment. We are more than happy to work with respectful clients regarding various treatment options that will work best for their pet."

In your case, our product advisor William was requesting your banking information in order to EFT transfer your deposit back to you, but that was not provided.

First of all, your daughter had a deep conditioning treatment which doesn’t involve any chemicals. The styling was done according to her wishes since you were not present. Secondly, as a matter of policy, Curl Bar has specific protocols for addressing grievances of which you’re aware since this was your daughter’s third visit to Curl Bar. You were offered a re-styling appointment for your daughter’s hair to be braided free of charge which you accepted and subsequently missed with no advise. Lastly, your payment was refunded in full per your request. Curl Bar prides itself on complete customer satisfaction and our reputation hinges on that. Our commitment is to seek amicable resolution but you’ve obviously chosen not to co-operate with us and instead resort to a non-constructive and slanderous approach and that is very unfortunate. All the same, we wish you luck with future care for your daughter’s hair and advise you to make the time to be with her for not just the consultation but the entire process as well in order to avoid misunderstandings and false accusations."

I understand your concern and it is also troubling for me to see a patient dying in the circumstance that Meaw did. I reviewed his file and all the calculations for the medications were appropriate for a patient of his age, medical state and weight.  At this point I am uncertain of the reason for his death. Perhaps this may be related with the chronic diarrhea that was affecting him for some time before this visit.  In order to clarify your concerns and also help us to provide the best advice to any other patient in the future, I still encourage you to consider an autopsy on Meaw (as we discussed over the phone). I recommend you to do this by an independent board certified pathologist (University of Guelph is an option). Our hospital can carry the cost of this test as it is very important for us to improve every day and provide the best advice always.  I consider that this test may give you some peace of mind about the cause of Meaw's death and also allow us to learn about  the case.  Please consider our suggestion and do not hesitate to contact us so we can guide you through the process or we can clarify any other concerns or questions that you have."

The quick response our booking process provides has been especially important during this COVID-19 pandemic with its surge in distressed pet owners seeking help. When a client requests a time slot that is no longer available, our system automatically prompts one of our third-party phone representatives to phone the client and assist them. This reviewer was fully aware of this policy when she made her booking on our website as she selected the option reading: \"I am a NEW CLIENT… Only provide a PHONE CALL if my requested time slot is not available.\"As our mobile medical system is not set up for primary communications through texts/emails, we did do our best to send this person some helpful suggestions for working out the details of her booking and of the veterinary consultation to follow. One of these suggestions was to have a friend or family member assist her in speaking to our veterinary support team on her behalf. The special-needs clients we have served in the past have used this method to communicate with our healthcare team. There was no intention to offend her in any way. From our experience with working with deaf or hard-of-hearing clients, there are also a number of government-funded interpreter and relay services and even phone apps that specifically assist individuals with making phone calls (if friends and family are not available). We are not sure why this reviewer declined to contact us using one of these readily-available services.Finally, we would like to respond specifically to the last line in this person's review:  \"*I did warn the clinic that I was going to write a negative review in my 3rd report* - they have not responded to me.\" The Toronto Mobile Veterinary Services has a policy of refusing service to individuals who attempt to bully, intimidate, and/or blackmail our hardworking staff who are already doing their very best to help as many pets they can - especially during this unprecedented pandemic that is affecting everyone.Respectfully,Dmitry, Office Manager at the Toronto Mobile Veterinary Services."

We cannot reverse transactions directly from Debit.  William was requesting your banking information in order to EFT transfer your deposit back to you, but that was not provided.

You arrived with Nugget with an urgent situation, and despite not having you as a client we rearranged appointments to see your pet and help stabilize their condition. Treatments were discussed with you and your partner, and we have received both verbal and signed consent from you prior to proceeding with the treatments.Stabilizing effort was made to the best of our ability, without prior knowledge of the diagnosis. Transfer for overnight monitoring and further care sometimes would be needed pending the patient's condition. As we are not staffed overnight, this would be irresponsible of us to offer considering the close monitoring Nugget needed.Regardless of the situation, swearing and yelling at team members while they are doing their best is never acceptable.

Front desk relays our policies in the way they are instructed to do so by management, but they are always sympathetic to clients and always both articulate and polite. In terms of our cancellation policy that applies to each service and it is noted both on the website and on our booking platform. It is also indicated by text message. Our stylists have 10+ years of expereience (some with 15+ years) and so their time is valuable and booked well in advance. When there is an untimely cacellation, it impacts their entire day and earnings, and so in an industry that was rocked by COVID-19 for 14 months without pay or work, it is important that their time be protected and that they receive pay when appointments or services are cancelled outside the scope of our cancellation policy. That is the case with all salons and spas of our calibre in Toronto. I am sorry again, that you will not be returning. We do wish you all the very best.Thanks,Sol & Alysha, Management "

We value the time of both our clients and our dedicated team, and we strive to maintain a punctual schedule to ensure a seamless experience for everyone.Nonetheless, our receptionist/front desk person made an effort to assist you by informing you that you could still have your lash appointment. We appreciate your efforts in taking an Uber to arrive as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, upon your arrival, our technicians determined that there was insufficient time to complete the full lash service without compromising the quality and attention to detail we pride ourselves on.While we understand your frustration with not receiving a phone call during your commute, our salon prioritizes providing services to clients who arrive on time, as it allows us to maintain the integrity of our appointments throughout the day. In situations where clients are significantly delayed, it is challenging to rearrange the schedule and accommodate everyone effectively.We genuinely regret any miscommunication that may have occurred and the resulting inconvenience it caused you. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to offer you a special promo for a future appointment, where we can ensure you receive the exceptional service you deserve.Please contact our salon directly, we will be more than happy to discuss further details.Thank you again for sharing your experience. We value your feedback and will use it to improve our services and communication with our clients.Best regards,The Beauty House Team"

We value clear communication with our clients, and we are continually working to improve in this aspect.Regarding the outcome of your lash extension, we acknowledge that there was a misunderstanding, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Despite the initial issues, you did agree to have the lashes redone, and our team made every effort to ensure your satisfaction. Our front desk team had an extended conversation with you, explaining our commitment to assisting you throughout your lash journey and offering a complimentary adjustment to address any concerns. We genuinely care about our client's satisfaction, and we made multiple attempts to reach out to you to ensure you were happy with the results. We are disappointed to hear that you chose to have the lashes removed at another salon, as we were eager to make things right for you.Please know that our team is here to provide exceptional service and support, and we are always open to addressing any issues that may arise.Sincerely,The Beauty House Team"

While we are thrilled that you enjoyed a great meal with Fanny's great service, we're truly sorry for any confusion caused over your credit card charge. The pending charge amount is not always what will actually be posted to your account, and this is because a merchant may pre-authorize an amount before the transaction’s complete. This is often to make sure there are enough funds available before putting a charge through. In the case of dining at a restaurant, it's not uncommon for your issuer to preauthorizes an additional 20% to allow room for tips, which was the case here. Just because it was preauthorized doesn't mean it was actually posted to your account, and we're sorry it caused any worry. When it comes to the case of getting change back, please let us know if there's an error -- we do our very best to make sure everything is accurate, but if there's been a mistake, we want to know so we can correct it. We've been serving our community for over 60 years, and our reputation is very important to us. We would never take advantage of our customers.Btw, we're happy to see you both came back today.  You're probably clear up all confusions about the pending transaction charge, and knew how it works.The system is generated automatically and just have to patiently wait for the processing time, it's out of our control.  We have been business over 60 years and always try to serve great Chinese food & provide friendly service.Occasionally, we have to absorb some negative reviews just because the customers misunderstood and got upset w little thing posted bad reviews about us.  I hope you're realize by now that we did nothing wrong but just to please customers!Twin Dragon Management"

		"owner_response": "Hi there Mrs. Mitchell. We firstly would like to thank you for your business in purchasing your 2009 Land Rover LR3 with 161,000km (purchase April 10th 2018). We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced and take your feedback very seriously. On the issue of a small plastic piece missing we did in fact send it by mail. The apparent fact that it did not reach you may indicate the package was lost or something of that nature. A simple phone call to us would have cleared up the issue rather quickly. On to the subject of the tires. Upon purchase we certify the vehicle with a licensed mechanic with many years of experience so to say that they were the wrong size seems a little odd but again, could've been easily resolved with a phone call to us. Hubs/wheel bearings can wear out over time. They will often make an obvious humming noise while driving which will indicate that they may need to be looked at. They were not making any noise whatsoever at the time you purchased the vehicle and if they were we would have attended to the issue. This issue most likely took place a while after you bought the vehicle (purchased the vehicle over a year ago April 10th 2018). On the issue of the fluids (engine oil, transmission oil,etc) these are part of regular maintenance and not part of a safety certification. This is something we always make very clear to our clients during the purchase process. In terms of the Battery and alternator these issues usually come about from accidentally leaving a light,radio or something battery-consuming on. Being only a month after purchasing we would've assisted you with that if you would've called us. We cannot help with an issue if we are unaware of the issue. All in all we apologize again for any inconvenience you may have experienced with your vehicle but also understand that the mechanics you took it to are in the business of making money so be sure to take it to a mechanic you can trust because 12k seems a little steep for the issues you've mentioned. If you'd like to contact us about the matter please feel free 416 645 0196!"

When your husband came in to drop off your cat for cremation, as we have never seen you as a client before, we got him to fill out a Client/Patient information sheet. We used that information that was provided, to process your kitty for cremation. When we got her ashes back we were unable to get in contact with you because we only had the phone number that was provided by your husband and that was incorrect. We had no other way of getting hold of you. When we figured out that the name of the pet that you were giving us was completely different from what your husband wrote on the sheet we made sure that we sent the ashes back to the company and get it changed to what you wanted it. We are so sorry that you had to wait an extra couple of weeks to get the name changed but it was not a problem for us to do that for you.

The reason why your pet waited for so long in the clinic is that you are scheduled for a drop off appointment that you agreed on, where your pet is seen in between the doctors appointments, we do try our best to explain to everyone what this entails and that your pet will be seen depending on how the day goes. Even though the clinic is busy at all times we are not keen of rushing any services/care that we provide to the pets who come in the hospital and this doesn't mean that we intend to ignore any drop offs who are waiting, we try our best everyday to attend to everyone efficiently. I understand that the price was different for your two pets however we do have different exam fees for young(kittens/puppy's exam fee are $59+tax) and for adult cats/dogs the exam fee is $87+tax, as much as we value your pets and prioritise their health we also need to consider the staff's safety, the reason why we recommend sedation to continue with the exam is because the more that we force to examine your pet while they're stressed, the more we are giving a traumatic experience for them which we do not want. We also wanted to make clear that we would never prescribed an antibiotic when a pet wasn't examined, it might be that the doctor wanted to prescribed a medication that will help your pet be more relaxed/calmed on their next visit.Every pet who comes in the clinic and every client who trust us is very important to us, we understand that our services and recommendations wasn't the best option for you. We hope you would find a place that can best fit your needs. We appreciate your feedback and we'll surely use this as a tool to improve our services moving forward."

The car was parked for one year and not used at all by the previous owner. You came to me in October to make the necessary repairs to pass the safety inspection.\n\nEvery step of the repairs I kept you informed of the progress made. I still have the photos and videos that I sent you of the damage. Regarding your claims:\n\n1. I sent you camera footage of the damages and the extent of the repair of extracting the bolts. It is a common issue with this vehicle for the bolts to rust out, as there is no beauty cover to protect it from water running down it. \n2. The intake manifold needed to be purchased from the dealer. I had checked with all the wreckers to try and keep the cost down but could not find one as the vehicle was too new. Unfortunately,  due to the scarcity of new parts, it took two weeks to get the part, which I had informed you ahead of time. \n3.  The claim that I used a \"used oil filter\" is false. I installed a new engine oil cooler with all the gaskets. The new oil cooler always comes with a brand new filter. You are more than welcome to check that. I also suspect that Mr Lube made that claim to secure your business as an ongoing customer. I had another customer tell me that Mr Lube told him the same thing, and that he had previously taken it to Costco. A filter after a couple of months, driven in the winter will not look new, and they may have even shown you a different filter, just so they can get your business in the future. \n4.  Your claim on damaging the transmission is impossible. I did no repairs to the transmission or anything that effects the transmission. You drove the vehicle from October to January without any issue. \n5. Wooden screws?  I think you made a typo and meant to refer to screws used for wood.  Screws and bolts were used to secure the intake manifold. \n\nI have to admit that I am disappointed with your review. I did everything possible to keep costs to a minimum. I kept you informed and got your permission every step of the way. Provided you with photos and video of what was wrong and what I did to fix things. I asked you to contact me if there were any issues,  and unfortunately you did not. I even tried to reach out to you after you left this review but you never responded. \n\nI understand that cost of car repairs can be upsetting, and you are trying to put the blame somewhere, but I stand by my work and I have photos and videos. Unfortunately it seems you have been mislead by other mechanics to secure your business.  I think a lot of misunderstanding could have been avoided if you contaced me. \n\n"

We did, in fact, speak to the sales representative that assisted you and he informed us that your conversations that day went pretty well and he is unsure as to why you're upset. He mentioned that you wanted approximately 6-7k more for your trade-in then we could give at the time. So as not to make you upset he explained that maybe selling it privately would be a better option for you as you wanted above retail value for your vehicle and dealers generally give you wholesale value. This was not meant to insult you but more so to advise you on how you'd get closer to the value you wanted. He even mentioned to you, as per our conversation with him, that your vehicle (2020 Honda Civic) would be a very easy vehicle for you to sell due to its popularity. In regards to your second complaint, the particular vehicle you were interested was an extremely low, and fair price and we could not accommodate a discount on that unit. All in all we hope you do visit us again as we would be happy to assist you.

Based on our records it seems that you have missed a couple of appointments with us and we have this in place so that the Physician`s time is not wasted and that patient`s who need appointment`s can be seen.  This is common practice with clinic`s.  As for our same day booking, we think that as a clinic that services a family practice, those patient`s must be given priority.  We do however, keep a few spots for same day appointment`s for patient`s who are not part of the Family Practice, we just ask that you call early enough to be able to secure a spot as they are limited and highly in demand.  On the day that you called to make an appointment and one was held for you, you were informed of this cancellation policy and when you called back to cancel, it was too late to fill your spot and was therefore a lost appointment.Also Thank You for asking your friends and family to so graciously leave us 1 star ratings as well especially since none of them (Kamer, Ipek and Ecenaz Tatar) have ever been to Integra."

		"owner_response": "Dear Mr. LeatWe are glad to hear that you are happy with your vehicle. I would like to point out that your review is factually inaccurate. Nowhere on your bill of sale/contract does it say that Car Solutions Canada would  provide winter tires nor did you pay for any additional tires as you state in your review. Your bill of sale clearly states that we will “check for winter tires”.In fact, you received a discount off the sale price of the vehicle and the salesman told you ifthe car already came with winter tires when it arrived at the dealership (sometimes vehicles we purchase come in with 2 sets of tires), they would be stored in the back of the dealership and if we had them, we were happy to offer them to you at no extra charge. The salesman checked the back to see if we had any at the time of purchase, and he advised you at that time that we did not. He further offered that if a set of winter tires that match your car do come in to the dealership with a different car in the short future, we would call you and offer those to you. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Every time you called the dealership over the next several months, the salesman took your call and checked again to see if we had winter tires we could give you for free, but there was nothing available.It seems that you misunderstood the arrangement at the time of purchase. It feels like you are attempting to intimidate or bully us into providing you with a free set of tires through posting a bad review. This is not only hurtful but very disappointing as the salesman that helped you really went above and beyond with the customer service provided to you. Perhaps you are correct.......and thank you for making this crystal clear to us........that we shouldn’t offer anything as a courtesy unless it is in fact paid for.Although we strive to ensure that all our customers have an excellent experience, this does not include giving things away for free.Best Regards,Car Solutions Canada Inc.

At Lola Salon, we take pride in providing excellent customer service, and we strive to do our best in this area.Regarding your most recent appointment, our system logs all bookings, cancellations, and changes. According to our records, it appears that your appointment was not successfully booked. As your booking was made online, and not through our team, there's unfortunately little we can do in this situation. We understand that this is frustrating, and while we try to accommodate all our clients, it's not always possible to rearrange others' appointments on short notice.However, I want to assure you that we will be discussing this issue with our front-end team to ensure we handle such situations more effectively in the future. We want to improve and are committed to making our customers experience better.As for the other situations you mentioned, we appreciate your understanding. There are times when we must adjust appointments, and we do this with the belief that well-cared-for staff make for great stylists. This includes allowing them to take time off when sick. Our second location can sometimes be busy, with our front-end team managing check-ins, check-outs, and other tasks, which may delay our response to calls and emails. We do, however, check voicemails frequently and respond as soon as possible. Additionally, both of our salon locations are easily found through a quick Google search.Your feedback is valuable to us, and we'll use it to further improve our customer service for our amazing clientele.Best regards,Management "

We would have loved the opportunity to discuss them in person during your visit, but at the time we were not given any indication that you were unsatisfied, considering that you scheduled a dental surgery with a specific request for Dr. Asotra for a few days later.We have made significant changes in staffing and protocol in the 5+ years since those negative Yelp reviews were made, and we fully stand behind the recommendations of our doctors. Dr. Asotra is a Fear Free certified veterinarian, meaning she implements numerous tactics to earn our patients’ trust and put them at ease while at the clinic; one of these tactics is giving easy-to-chew Benny Bullies to create a positive association with the doctor without inflicting pain while they chew.  We have had positive feedback from our clients regarding our Fear Free practices and we continue to use them confidently.We would never force anyone into any treatment for their pet, and, had you expressed concerns about the doctor’s recommendations during your visit, she would have been more than happy to discuss, clarify, and explain them to you further.Dr. Asotra could absolutely tell that you care very much about Sophie. You expressed that you wanted to make sure she was not in pain while waiting for her surgery, so Dr. Asotra proceeded to prescribe pain medication for her. She also prescribed an antibiotic to prevent infection from developing.  The antibiotics that were given to Sophie had not yet expired but were indeed expiring at the end of February.  If they were given as prescribed, then Sophie would have finished the course of medication far ahead of the date of expiration.While we do happily offer free dental assessments with our technicians, a broken tooth is a medical condition that requires a doctor's assessment and thereby a consultation fee.  The appointment included a head-to-toe examination to determine if Sophie is fit for anesthesia for her dental surgery, as well as an in-depth conversation of treatment options and the risks and benefits of each option.Our main priority is Sophie's health and welfare.  Although the dental surgery was not performed by us, we are happy to know that she received the care she needed.Melanie, Practice Manager"

As we are always looking for ways to improve, after speaking to your stylist we have found that you have left our establishment completely satisfied and happy with your service. We are completely baffled and do not understand why you would leave us such a review. I understand you are an accountant so you have to understand that the amount you have paid to us includes taxes that we don't keep, but it is directly paid to the Canadian Government. We wanted to help with your situation by providing you a discount. However,  I guess you were under the assumption we don't charge taxes had we provided you a discount and as a result, you were dissatisfied with the amount you had paid and left us a bad review.

In the meantime we put a sign on the door so it wouldn't slam shut as it was a windy night. Unfortunately, while the owner was trying to fix the door, wasps flew in, which made him and everyone else feel rightfully uncomfortable. The decision was made to fix the door after closing. Our kitchen is taken seriously. We have passed every inspection with ease. We estimate that the average adult eats about half lb of meat. Accordingly we feel that the platter you ordered, which comes with 3.5 lbs of meat, can easily serve 3-4 people.

Please contact us by phone at 416-784-4444 or by email at info@ctvrc.ca so that we can get more information and look into your experience as described. Thank you and take care.Update (Mar14): Hi Mary, we understand you don’t wish to revisit your experience, we only asked that you reach out so we could clarify your identity. We were able to locate you in our system but your surname reflected on Google does not match what we were provided, so please forgive that we weren’t initially able to do so.We appreciate your perspective on your experience with us. We apologize for any miscommunication that happened regarding when you could expect updates from us, but we do see that one of our ER doctors addressed your concerns directly and fully once you’d raised them with us. We also apologize that you felt we were vague with you. In general, our patient updates are highly detailed unless a patient’s status has been consistent and care is being maintained as arranged and we’ll say so. We always encourage, and are happy to address, any questions or concerns a client might have.Please understand that our approach to patient care is to provide our clients with the gold standard in a given case and work with clients step-wise to restore a patient’s health. We realize how this can be perceived by clients, but it’s our duty to let you know your options so you have all the information to make an informed decision. We hope you can appreciate this.Lastly, please know that all patients in our care are monitored regularly and consistently. Very unfortunately, though, patients can take a turn for the worse quickly, and when that happens, we are in touch with the family right away to discuss next step(s). This was true in your cat’s case as well, but we are sorry for the distress that the circumstances caused.Again, we are very sorry for your loss, Mary, and we wish you peace during this difficult time. Please take care."

The 2008 Mercedes GL320 you purchased had over 150,000km on it. Our team is very accommodating and we try our best to make you happy...when we received a call from you in which you informed us that you had an issue we took that very seriously and asked you to bring the vehicle in. Once the issue was resolved we asked you to come and pick your vehicle up. When you informed us of the car not starting we asked you once again to bring the car over so that we can help you out. We spent close to $3000.00 on your vehicle simply so that you can enjoy your GL320. Once more we do not sell brand new vehicles, but if our customers have an issue we are always here to help as long as they understand that these vehicles are not brand new.Cheers :-)"

Unfortunately, we are NOT an emergency clinic so we don't provide the range of tests that are available at one. You brought your puppy as a Walk-In emergency visit 2 hours before closing, our doctor then examined your puppy, discussed her inital findings and potential toxicity/neurological issues and recommended that you take your puppy to a 24 hour emergency hospital where if necessary they could provide the required testing and monitoring over night.Had we been advised beforehand that you were coming or the nature of the symptoms, we would have advised you go straight to the emergency hospital, but we did not get that opportunity. We did not charge you for the examination as we knew that you would incur another examination fee at the emergency hospital, and wanted to help out. We are very grateful that the emergency hospital was able to see you so quickly as we know just how busy they have been. We are so glad to work closely with such amazing emergency hospitals in this city as they provide emergency and specialist care for our patients when we are closed, or when we need to refer to a specialist.Not all hospitals have the same testing/facilities available that emergency hospitals have so our doctor followed standard protocol and deemed this the best course of action in order for your puppy to get the care he needed in a timely fashion. If you have any questions or would like to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I can be reached at 416-690-0625 or reception@vetstoronto.comWarm regards,Fiona.

In addition, when a custom appliance is prescribed an impression is taken and is sent to lab to fabricate the retainer. The modelwork is destroyed in the process of making an appliance.

Mam, if you had an issue with the vehicle you purchased all you have to do is give us a call, set up a time when you can bring it and we will take care of the issue at hand...It's no problem at all. However, we cannot fix an issue until we inspect that issue in which case you have to bring the vehicle to us. If you choose not to bring it to us there's not much we can do. And in regard to how much you and other customers spend, you're right its not a small amount of money and we do try our best to make you happy, but these are USED products and they may have issues from time to time but our friendly staff here at Dynasty are always here to help!!Cheers :-)"

The appointment will only be booked once you confirm. Once the confirmation is received and reviewed, an e-mail is sent with the appointment details.Sometimes there are limitations on how often procedures will be covered, such as in this case, that one may not be aware of if they do not read the terms of the policy.Remember, we are treating you, not your dental plan!

The fact that you can see small blemishes and other minor things better in the sunlight as opposed to an indoor showroom is pretty common knowledge.

Unfortunately, that day we were fully scheduled with no cancellations and did not take on any new bookings, so it seems there may have been some miscommunication between you and the receptionist. The difficulty with adding another sick pet on an already full schedule is that we would be unable to devote the appropriate time and attention needed to properly assess and care for your pet, and these are standards we will not compromise on. We are lucky to be in a family of several high-quality veterinary clinics with whom we can coordinate when at capacity, and did suggest these as alternatives to get your pet seen as soon as possible. We are also in the process of extending our weekend capacity, so we can minimize situations such as this.  We are glad you were able to get Churchill taken care of, and we wish you both all the best. Sincerely, Jen B, RVT, Practice Manager"

In line with our hospital protocols all of our veterinarians discuss all treatments to be performed on our patients with their owners before proceeding. While we cannot discuss medical care for your pets via this review, we always encourage our clients to bring any concerns they have at the time of the appointment and we will reassess.

However as indicated in our initial review, your father came into our dealership & purchased a vehicle that he would have shipped to Ghana. When the vehicle was at Ghana, he indicated to us that the radio was not working & we told him to provide us with the radio code, as we would use it to fix the issue. Your father did provide us with the the code and we sent it to Germany to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, the radio code was not the issue and we told your father to take the car to Mercedes- Benz and again he did do so. They informed him that the issue was the radio and he would need a replacement. We again had no issue replacing the radio for your father, asking him to provide us with the radio Id for the radio. After receiving the radio Id, we looked everywhere to find a compatible radio for your fathers vehicle. Every vehicle uses specific radio's you cannot put just any radio in a car even if it is the same make and model, this is where the use of a radio Id is needed. We finally found a compatible radio for your father's car, with the matching Id, it was suppose to be delivered on a Wednesday but unfortunately the radio did not arrive until the Thursday, we had to check the radio to make sure it would work with your fathers vehicle as we did take into consideration that the vehicle would be shipped to Ghana. We informed your that the part came to Bell Auto, however when you came into the dealership you had an issue with the fact that the radio had one knob missing, and we informed you to just remove the knob from the radio your father currently had. We kept the radio and you left the dealership. A couple of days later, we ordered a radio for one of our Mercedes- Benz that arrived at the dealership and was not compatible with the vehicle but it was a match for your fathers vehicle. We called you and informed you about this, before even thinking to return it to the parts location, to get the correct radio. We paid for the shipping to send it to Ghana which cost $200.00 plus tax and gave you the tracking number for the radio. We lost $1000.00 because the radio you did not want which was initially for your fathers vehicle passed the return days and could not be returned. The radio we supplied you with that was for one of our vehicle was also a loss of $1000.00 because we provided it to you and did not return it. As a company we went through a lot of trouble and still could not make you happy. However, we honestly hope you enjoy your new radio and thank you for your review."

Now, let us start off by stating that Mayor has been with us since 2013 and has always been one of our top salesman especially in regards to customer satisfaction. Anyone can clearer see this by the many, many reviews on google praising his professionalism. However, contrary to this we discussed the situation with Mayor and he explained that from the moment you came into the dealership you were very short, argumentative, and rude. He was trying his best to show you any and every vehicle you asked about as well as answering any questions you had. He also mentioned that due to a small misunderstanding with one of our vehicles you and your spouse became incredibly heated and began speaking in a very argumentative manner. Despite this Mayor brushed that off, calmed the situation down and continued with his duty and assisted you with all your car related needs until you had left the dealership. He also mentioned that you left on a relatively good note and even told Mayor that a gentleman would contact him to arrange financing for you. All in all we respect your feedback but are just a little taken back by it as Mayor has always been a favourite of our clients here at Dynasty Auto. Although, we do welcome you to come in or give us a call to clear up the matter. You can contact our management at 416 645 0196.

The pending charge amount is not always what will actually be posted to your account, and this is because a merchant may pre-authorize an amount before the transaction’s complete.

In the case of dining at a restaurant, it's not uncommon for your issuer to preauthorize an additional 20% to allow room for tips.

I looked this morning at the registered clients database and there isn’t any account created under her name or yours at all! Therefore, the reason why your order was not here when you came in yesterday, is because it was never placed.I hope you understand that we are a veterinary clinic, not a pet food store and that our priority is to take care of our patients’ wellness, as well as sick and injured pets in need of veterinary services. Our Online Store is the ideal place to order pet food and accessories fast and efficiently and our 500+ registered clients are very satisfied with the service.

However, please know that the estimate you received initially and on the day of surgery remained the same.During the procedure, the veterinarian will call you to discuss the diagnostic results and go over the plan for extractions. This conversation will include any updated time estimates for the extractions and address any additional findings. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact time required to remove the teeth until your pet is under anesthesia and the necessary diagnostics have been completed.We apologize if our communication was unclear and led to any confusion. Our top priority is always the care and well-being of your pet, and we regret that this experience did not fully reflect our commitment to quality service.

Our doctors best interest is to recommend the best course of treatment for every pet that we see in the practice, we want to make sure that we are exploring every concern through diagnostics if necessary so we can avoid missing any potential factors that can make our existing concerns worse. I completely understand if our prices may seem steep however we are happy to accomodate our clients capacity and provide alternatives if needed.We reached out to you at noon once the results were available and as explained by our staff, we tried our best to accomodate to every clients that we can eventhough our staff was limited at that time. We understand that this can be frustrating and we try to go out of our way to support our patients however we have a 0 tolerance policy on aggresive behaviour towards our team. This doesn't only undermine the well-being of our team members but also detracts from our ability to provide the exceptional service that our clients deserve. We understand that your emotions were running high which had caused you to raise your voice and interupt our Doctor constantly while he was talking to you however we do not appreciate your words and actions towards our team. Despite the challenges we faced all we wanted was to resolve the issue at hand in a respectful manner. Dr. Oscar had come in on a Sunday when the clinic is closed so he could call you and check-in, he made sure to ask our team to follow up with you on Monday which we did, and we made sure to fit you into our schedule so that we can see your pet in for a recheck which was free of charge.We acknowledge that not all recommendations and findings are easy to hear however we did try our best to communicate in a way that would please you. Our doctors work hard on a day-to-day basis to not only help our clinic but also help every patient that walks in and out of our hospital. They are also humans and they are entitled to get a little break once in a while. We welcome every client and we have never been discriminatory towards anyone in any way. Our team culture is founded on principles of diversity and inclusion and It's important to acknowledge that perspectives can vary, and it's possible that we may see things differently at times.We truly hope that you can find a clinic that will fit your needs.KrisPractice Manager"

The staff here have been trained in fear-free techniques, and when a pup is scared and/or in pain, the less stressful and safest way to examine a wound does mean sedation. This way, we can also make sure to do a thorough check for infection pockets and other complications that your pup wouldn't have allowed us to do while awake. Of course, it is your decision to decline if you so wish, but we are required to offer and explain all the options to make sure we're providing the best care possible.I really hope your pup is doing better, and if you want to continue this conversation, please don't hesitate to call or email the clinic and ask for me, Dr. Delgado, or Jane.Sincerely, Dr. Lucia Delgado"

The duration of your wait, as the type of the clinic suggests, is influenced by various factors such as the time of day and the number of prior walk-ins. In addition, we distinguish ourselves by offering the option to schedule appointments, a practice less common in walk-in clinics. However, in walk-in settings, appointments are based on a first-come, first-served basis and may not always be exact due to the nature of our commitment to providing prompt care. To manage expectations and ensure client satisfaction, we communicate this matter to our patients prior to scheduling appointments."

Patient's with very low prognosis and quality of life are recommended hospitalization or euthanasia in the pet's best interest. Should the owner's decline the recommended treatment for a sick pet, a waiver is signed and kept on the medical record.Mikki presented to us in a serious and painful medical condition, for which immediate treatment and action was required. Euthanasia and hospitalization were the two humane options given.Veterinarians are the medical advocates for our beloved pet's, but ultimately the decision is the client's.Mikki was very special to you, and I wish there was something else we could do.I'm truly sorry that you feel this way. I would like to welcome the opportunity to review Mikki's medical records or any further concerns with you.If there is anything we can do to support you or your family, we would be happy to do so.Sincerely,Belinda Gomes | ManagerAnimal Hospital of High Park416-763-4200"

I will follow up with you privately as I do not want to share your dog’s medical history on a public forum, but I would like the opportunity to discuss the details of your concerns regarding the mass and the ball ingestion. To hear you think we don’t want to help you is disheartening, this is never our intention. The medication you had requested is not something we have prescribed for your dog since 2017, so we were simply asking for a prescription from the oncologist in order to dispense accurately. I will be sending an email separately, and hope to get the chance to talk to you further.All the best,Heather, Practice Manager"

Even though I cannot discuss the specifics of your procedure here due to privacy limitations, fortunately, we were able to talk over the phone. Hopefully, your concerns were resolved after our chat.In general, Root Canal is a complex procedure. As a result, a patient's recovery experience can be very different each time it is performed. I definitely appreciate that there is an expectation of having a similar recovery process, but due to the difference in the severity of the underlying problem, the post-operation recovery process can be quite different for each tooth. The most important factor is to have a successful treatment in the end that resolves the underlying issue long term. Having said that, I completely understand the recovery process for some dental procedures can be quite bothersome, but rest assured that we always do everything in our power to make it as smooth as possible.Lastly, I wanted to apologize for the miscommunication that you had with our office. I have spoken with our team to take the necessary steps to improve our follow-up calls.If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to email us at info@dentistryonking.net, and I will personally address them ASAP.With care,- Dr. Alavi"

We offered to set up an appointment and you declined. A proper diagnosis and treatment plan by telephone does not meet our clinic’s professional standards for emergent care. If you have concerns about the current health of your pet(s), we offer a Pet Health Checker triage tool on our website or you can speak with one of our RVT's to help guide your decision to pursue emergency treatment.After completing an internal review, your portrayal of our front line staff members seems unreasonably harsh and inaccurate.

We understand that the dual-location setup of our clinic can sometimes lead to misunderstandings, and we are actively working to streamline this process to ensure a smoother experience for our clients. Regarding your concern about the missed appointment fee, we typically do not charge patients if they arrive within a reasonable time when they go to the wrong location. However, upon investigation we noticed that you were already past the grace period when you arrived at the first location, which led to the application of the fee in this instance. We genuinely apologize for any inconvenience or frustration this situation may have caused you.

While we are disappointed to hear that you don’t enjoy your haircut we do want to assure you that there are ways to maintain the volume in your hair after washing! During your corrective haircut appointment, our stylist added some more layers to create more dimension, volume, and movement in your hair. After washing your hair, we recommend blow drying your hair with a round brush to maintain the voluminous look you want. If you air dry your hair after washing, your hair’s texture and layers will fall flat. This could be the reason why you liked your hair while you were still at the salon and suddenly had a change of heart after your first wash. We hope that you’ll continue to love your haircut with our styling tip. Trust us, you’ll see lots of volume— just blow dry with a round brush after washing :)If you have any further concerns or questions for our stylists, kindly reach out to us at info@clsalon.com and we’d be happy to discuss."

Despite knowing you previously recruited friends (who were not clients of our hospital) to post negative reviews and ignored our attempts to discuss your concerns, we made time to care for your dog when you walked in without an appointment or phone call. Our doctors always inform owners when further diagnostic tests are indicated, but it is up to the client if they choose to proceed with the recommendations provided. Please try to understand we cannot diagnose problems when the methods used to detect them are declined. Our doctors spent hours with you over the next few days helping to provide insight and support to the best of our ability for a pet that was not in our direct care. We were very saddened to learn that Buffy encountered complications and wish things had turned out differently. It's upsetting, however, to see blame publicly placed on us for events that occurred at a different hospital. I am very sorry to see you are still struggling with the passing of Buffy, and I know she was a very special dog. If you would like to speak about this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me directly at 416-966-1830.Sincerely,Jen B, RVTPractice Manager"

Anyhow, if you call us and listen to the message on our voice mail...The message clearly state that\" The clinic is closed during last week and re-open for regular hours on Monday February the 4th and if patient think the issue that they have is an urgent matter they would need to proceed to the hospital........\" When the clinic re-open on Monday, we look into results and called patients with more urgent result in first than we reply to phone calls and email....in which we did not see any email from you ( not sure if there's an error when you sending the email to us) I also notice on your file that the clinic left a voice mail for you on your contact number today. Please check you voice mail and call us back. Thank you for your feed back and we hope this helps you understand our procedure better."
