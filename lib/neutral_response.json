I see one of our doctors was in touch less than 48 hours after your visit to discuss Samba's results; I apologize that did not meet your expectations. It does take some time for laboratory results to come in and be reviewed by a veterinarian, who then tailors a recommended plan of action. To hear you believe we are financially motivated is disappointing. Follow up assessments and/or testing do come with some cost, as additional services are required. If we did not charge for our services we would not be around to help any pets at all. I wish you and Samba well and have closed your file here. Sincerely, Jen B, RVT, Practice Manager."

Our tuition structure and non-refundable fee policy are designed to ensure the consistent high performance of our program.  We were able to confidently secure your child's space with us after we toured you, conducted one-on-one conversations to answer your questions, and subsequently enrolled your child fully into our program. Those services come at a cost for all organizations.It is impossible to make exceptions for one family without making them for others, which would put the quality of our program at risk if these services are not figured into our policy.  Like your family, all prospective parents are required to agree with these priorities before we accept any tuition, as clearly noted in our Parent Handbook and on the Child Enrolment Forms. With regards to the instances you've mentioned about past refund exceptions, please do keep in mind these were exceptional circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts.  We have reflected on your feedback in order to continue to provide the best possible experience for families."

		"owner_response": "*EDIT: Shoora came in and received her free pizza that I offered. Hopefully this one was up to your expectations. Hi Shoora, I'm sorry the pizza didn't meet your expectations. The mushroom pizza you purchased is isn't really the sauciest of pizzas to begin with but we will look at that pizza to see what we can improve. The sauce is made by mixing ricotta with whipped cream, garlic salt and pepper so you there wouldn't be ricotta dollops on the pizza. As for the mushrooms, we use cremini both cooked and raw as well as portobello which are not inexpensive. The pizza costs $31 but with the ranch and tax it that would be about $40. For the ranch, we just upsized our containers so I wouldn't consider it a small container. We also make it in-house with lots of good ingredients like 14% sour cream Hellmans mayo, dijon mustard as well as fresh chives and basil. I think it is a pretty good price for a dip made from scratch and not out of a bottle. That being said, I would like to make this right by giving you a complementary pizza of your choice the next time you are in the area. Thanks, Mark"

I would usually just write a positive response and try make you happy but I spoke to the manager and stylist who took care of you and also checked our video recordings of the day. I don’t understand why you would post such a negative review for situations that didn’t occur at your service.The stylist brought you a beverage and you where also offered water tea or wine by the manager twice and then by our assistant Steven until you decided to have one. The stylist did not pull your hair during your service as I watched her do your hair and this by no means occurred as your head was not being pulled and I know My stylist is extremely gentle. Our stylist tried to communicate with you but you didn’t interact and there was a barrier with communication but she and the manager tried there best to make sure they gave you good service. The stylist stayed back nearly 2 hours after her shift to make sure you where happy and you where not pleasant to her. The only thing here that has any truth was our water didn’t preform perfectly that day and we tried to manage the temperature and that we apologize for. Posting these reviews and having power to affect a business in an untruthful way is not acceptable. Usually I would always agree with a guest and try and rectify but I wouldn’t invite you back into our salon. I will be taking this further as this is not something I deem except-able."

In the event that this would have actually taken place we would have never sent any client away especially as soon as they got home from picking the vehicle up. We give 36 days to our clients on any issues they may have regardless of them purchasing extended warranty or not which makes you complaint a little odd.

I personally checked we did a dental work for Luna 6 months ago which is accompanied by a complimentary checkup after 6 months. My recommendation is to have a check up with us to figure out the reason that Luna's teeth have gotten yellow fast. In this appointment I would like to figure out what type of maintenance  Luna needs at home.Many thanksDr.T"
